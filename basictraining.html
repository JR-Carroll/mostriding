        <h1>Basic Rider Course</h1>
        <p>This course is aimed at beginner riders who have obtained their regular driver's license or have completed a driver's education course.   A minimum of five hours of classroom instruction prepares you for up to fifteen hours of practical riding in a controlled off-street environment, typically a parking lot that is free of obstacles and traffic. A motorcycle and helmet are available and included in your tuition.</p>
        <p>In the classroom you will learn about the different types of motorcycles, their controls, how they are operated and how to become a responsible rider. Your Rider Coach will advise you on what gear to wear for protection and comfort. You'll find out how alcohol and drugs adversely affect your ability to ride safely.</p>
        <p>The course concludes with a knowledge test and a riding skills evaluation. Once your Rider Coach hands you the course completion card, you will be happy knowing that you have gone the extra mile to develop your own safe riding techniques. This is a license waiver course. Upon successful completion, no further testing is required to obtain your motorcycle endorsement.</p>
        <p>For the 3 day classes, classroom starts Friday at 6:00 pm sharp, and continues until approximately 9:00 pm.Range exercises start on Saturday at 8:00 am sharp, in the parking lot. We continue in the classroom Saturday afternoon and then back on the motorcycles on Sunday again at 8:00 am sharp.</p>
        <p>For the 2 day classes, classroom and range exercises start on Saturday at 8:00 am sharp, in the parking lot. On Sunday,  we are back on the motorcycles on again at 8:00 am sharp. Tuition for this course is $300.00.</p>
